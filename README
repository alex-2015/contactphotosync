Contact Photo Sync

Lets you backup your high quality contact photos to your Picasaweb
Album. ICS based phones unfortunately lack this functionality (only the
small thumbnail photo is saved to Gmail contacts) and this is a solution
to it. Contact photos are saved under "Android Contact Photos" album on
Picasaweb.
